# Timetable

This project was generated with expo.

## Opening the project 

Clone the repo, navigate to your project-dir and run 'npm install' in the node.js command prompt under the timetable directory to build npm_modules directory. Make sure to install Expo-CLI for node.js. Run 'expo start' to start the server which will open up a development tab in your default browser and check if the project is valid. It will then show a QR code both in cmd prompt and browser which can be scanned to run the app. Note that npm install should be done only when the project is opened for the first time and the host computer and android/ios device must be on the same network. Incase you have any virtual machines installed, either disable its network adapter or use 'set REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME=my-custom-ip-address' where my-custom-ip-address is obtained by doing an 'ipconfig' in cmd and replacing it with its ipv4 address.

## Target device

This project is mainly targeted for the iPad(2017) model running latest stable iOS.
